                    <p>
                        I worked in VirtualBox to set up several virtual machines running Windows Server and Windows Desktops. 
                        I then managed each system to create a network in which they could interact with one another on. 
                        I also worked with the Widows Server tools to manage, set rules, and add users to other systems connected to the network.
